	%h2.section You can use this tool to get approval for an inverter energy system (such as solar) of up to 10kW capacity and 5kW export per phase, with a maximum being 30kW capacity and 15kW export across 3 phases.
	.section
		For systems greater than 30kW, you need to apply for
		%a{:href=>"/request-assessment"} technical assessment.

	%h4 There are a few things you'll need before you use this tool:
	.section
		%ul
			%li
				%p What sort of installation it is,
				%i eg solar / battery / wind
			%li
				%p The NMI and meter number - these can usually be found on page 2 of the electricity bill for the property
			%li
				%p Details of the proposed inverters i.e. manufacturer and model
			%li
				%p The expected total capacity and export requirements of the system
			%li
				%p How many phases at the property (most are single phase)

%a.button{:href=>"/terms-conditions"}

%a.button.secondary{:href=>"/request-assessment"}
