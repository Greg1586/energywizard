%div
	%h1 Welcome to AusNet Services
	%h2 You can use this tool to get approval for an inverter energy system (such as solar) of up to 10kW capacity and 5kW export per phase, with a maximum being 30kW capacity and 15kW export across 3 phases.
%div
	For systems greater than 30kW, you need to apply for
	%a{:href=>"/request-assessment"} technical assessment.
	%h3 There are a few things you'll need before you use this tool:
%div
	%ul
		%li
			%p What sort of installation it is,
			%i eg solar / battery / wind
		%li
			%p The NMI and meter number - these can usually be found on page 2 of the electricity bill for the property
		%li
			%p Details of the proposed inverters i.e. manufacturer and model
		%li
			%p The expected total capacity and export requirements of the system
		%li
			%p How many phases at the property (most are single phase)

%a.button{:href=>"/terms-conditions"}
	I've got all these things
%a.button.secondary{:href=>"/request-assessment"}
