	%hr
	%h2 Firstly, there are two main types of Bank Accounts.

	%h5 A Transaction account
	%p is an account used for everyday spending; for shopping, for paying for things with a card, and for paying bills online.

	%h5  A Savings account
	%p is an account in which your money accrues interest at a higher rate; meaning youâ€™ll earn on whatever you put away to save.

	%strong To make purchases using the money in your savings account, simply transfer it to a transaction account.

	%hr

	%h2 Which Account is Right for you depends on what you want to do.
