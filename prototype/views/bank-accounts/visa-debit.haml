				.accordion

						Is there any chance of it double-charging me?
						.accordion-toggle

					.accordion-content
						%p Visa payWave terminals are designed to only make one transaction per card at a time. All Visa payWave terminals are tested and certified to confirm that a card is only read once before the transaction is concluded. As a safeguard, each transaction must be complete or void before another one can take place.


				.accordion

						How do I know when a payment has been made?
						.accordion-toggle

					.accordion-content
						%p Your transaction is confirmed by illumination of four green indicator lights and a display message confirming that your transaction has been successful.

				.accordion
					.accordion-header
						What if I just walk past a Visa payWave reader?
						.accordion-toggle

					.accordion-content
						%p No. Your card needs to be within 4cm of the Visa payWave reader and held for more than half a second for a transaction to be processed. Also, the merchant must first enter the amount for you to approve, so there’ll be no ‘surprise’ purchases.

				.accordion
					.accordion-header
						Will you check to see if I have available funds in my account?
						.accordion-toggle

					.accordion-content
						%p Yes, all transactions are online and fully authorised. We will check you have available funds to conduct the transaction the same as a normal transaction.

				.accordion
					.accordion-header
						Can I use my card at places that don't have payWave terminals?
						.accordion-toggle

					.accordion-content
						%p The card’s chip and magnetic stripe also allows the card to be used in the same way a traditional Suncorp Bank Visa debit card is used wherever Visa is accepted (using a signature or PIN).

				.accordion
					.accordion-header
						Can I get cash out using Visa payWave?
						.accordion-toggle

					.accordion-content
						%p You’re not able to get cash out by just waving your card. If you have transaction accounts linked to your card and the merchant allows the ‘cash out’ option, you can get cash out by pressing either the ‘credit’, ‘cheque’ or ‘savings’ button, swiping or inserting your card into the terminal and entering your PIN.
